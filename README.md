# Digital Testing Readiness  
Checklists and preparation steps for multi-stakeholder digital testing and system readiness.

## About this repository
This repository contains lightweight documentation and practical notes on how to prepare institutions, teams and environments for digital system testing. It is focused on **process and coordination**, not on software development.

The materials are based on experience with EU and UN projects, where testing readiness often includes:
- clarifying roles and responsibilities  
- preparing test data and environments  
- aligning expectations with external partners  
- structuring communication and issue-handling workflows  

## Focus Topics
- Testing readiness checklists  
- Environment & access preparation  
- Stakeholder coordination before test execution  
- Basic reporting structure for observations and issues  

## Intended Use
These templates and notes are meant to:
- help teams organise testing phases more efficiently,  
- support multi-stakeholder projects with clear preparation steps,  
- complement formal quality assurance processes with process-oriented tools.

They can be reused or adapted in cross-border or multi-institutional digital projects.
